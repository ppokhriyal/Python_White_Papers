 Assertions
===========
Python Assert statement is a Debugging aid that test a condition.If the assert condition is true,
nothing happens and the code continues to execute normal.If the assert condition is false,an AssertionError 
exception is raised with an optional error message.This statement simply takes input a boolean condition.

Example
-------
In this example we have list of food temperatures.
If the food temperatures is >= to 26 food temperature is O.K but if it is not AssertionError will be throne.

>>food_temp = [40,26,39,30,25,21]
>>check_temp = 26

>>for i in food_temp:
   assert i>=26,"Temperature is too low,Rejected"
   print(f'{i} is O.K')

With Statement
==============
with statement is used in exception handling to make code cleaner and more readable.

Example
-------
>>with open('text.txt','w') as f:
	f.write('Hello World !')

Single Underscore
=================
Single underscore are a Python naming convention that indicates a name is meant for internal use.

Example:1
---------
>>class Test():
	def __init__(self):
		self.foo = 11
		self._bar = 23

>>t = Test()
>>t.foo
>>t._bar

Example:2
---------
Create a file named module.py

def external_func():
	return 23

def _internal_func():
	return 42

Now import the module

>>import a
>> external_func()
>>_internal_func()
